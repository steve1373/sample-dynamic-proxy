sample-dynamic-proxy
====================

Simple example using C# System.CodeDom to create a dynamic (subclass) proxy at run-time.  This example is very basic and does not include much in the way of comments.

The main Program.cs will show the example which consists of:
a) an IReservable interface
b) a Book class - which does not implement that interface
c) the dynamic (subclass) proxy creator

In the Documentation folder, I have the quick presentation slides and the original paper that was my inspiration.

This was an in-class example for CS-5373 at Texas Tech University on 4/24/2014.
